<p align="left">Customizable Discord bot template generator that supports multiple libraries.</p>
<br><hr><br>

# What is it?
> Krappy is a Discord bot **template** generator. It does ***NOT*** generate Discord bots. It just generates a codebase for a Discord bot, which is fancy talk for "it writes the boiler plate for a Discord bot".

---

# Why the name?
> Krappy is a joke name, mocking [Slappey](https://github.com/stuyy/slappey), the outdated `Discord.JS` template generator.
